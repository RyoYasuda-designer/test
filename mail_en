Dear {candidateName} (Candidate ID: 000000),

You have received a request to prepare for a reference check from {companyName}.

A reference check is a way for a potential employer to confirm that a candidate has provided the right information about their employment history and to learn more about their skills and character.
We ask people who can answer your reference to become "referees."

## Please complete the following steps:
1. Register your email address  
2. Register referee information  
3. Send request emails to referees  

Please complete this process as soon as possible to meet the deadline.

## Deadline
MM/DD 23:59

## Please proceed using the link below  
Start Reference Check

If you have ever completed one or more reference checks on our service, you may submit them for this time again.  
Reuse your reference

## Important Notes:
- This email is exclusive to the candidate for this reference check.
- You will not have access to the answers, and they will not be disclosed to any other third parties unless obligated by law to do so. Surveys will only be taken as personal opinions, not as representatives of the companies or organizations your referees belong to.
- For security reasons, your link will be active for 24 hours and can only be used once. Even if it deactivates, please click the deactivated link again, and we will send you another email with a valid link.

Thanks,
The back check team
